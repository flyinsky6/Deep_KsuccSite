# Deep_KsuccSite
Deep_KsuccSite, a novel and effective Deep learning models for predicting Succinylation sites, which adopted CTDC, EGAAC, APAAC, and embedding methods to encode peptides, then constructed three base classifiers using 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN, and finally utilized voting method to get the final results. K-fold cross-validation and independent testing showed that Deep_KsuccSite can serve as a powerful tool to identify Ksucc sites.
